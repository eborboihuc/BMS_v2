To compile the code:

1. Put the extracted files in a **<root_dir>**.
2. Install OpenCV 2.40+.
3. Go to **<root_dir>/BMS_CODE/** and use cmake to generate a sln file. 
   A makefile is also included for Linux. You may need to specify the 
   relevant OpenCV paths. 
4. Compile the code, and copy the executable to **<root_dir>**.
5. Launch Matlab and run **demo.m** in **<root_dir>**.
